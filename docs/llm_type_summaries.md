1. The first category consists of news and commentary about Donald Trump’s extensive legal exposure, spanning both criminal and civil proceedings. The articles describe prosecutions over hush money payments, election interference and classified documents, along with major civil fraud and defamation cases that have produced large financial penalties, appeals and bond postings. They also cover Trump’s own lawsuits against media and technology companies, as well as related litigation over his administration’s actions, such as foreign-aid freezes, tariffs and the use of “state secrets.” Across these stories, courts, prosecutors and investigators are scrutinized, and there is ongoing debate over presidential immunity, the limits of executive power and whether the legal system is treating Trump as any other litigant or engaging in politically motivated “lawfare.”

2. The second category covers how Trump dominates and reshapes electoral politics and partisan dynamics in the U.S. and beyond. The articles follow his journey through primaries, debates, VP and cabinet speculation, coalition-building and convention drama, as well as efforts by allies and rivals to position themselves around him. They show Republicans grappling with internal factions, redistricting fights and loyalty tests, while Democrats, independents and foreign leaders portray Trump variously as a threat, a symptom of deeper polarization or simply the central fact of contemporary politics. Campaign moments such as rallies, media stunts and debates sit alongside stories about RFK Jr., Biden and Harris, Canadian and European reactions, and even financial-market responses, illustrating how Trump’s political brand, messaging and controversies shape voter alignments, party strategies and broader narratives about democracy, norms and political legitimacy.

3. The third category follows Trump’s personal life, public image and business ventures outside strictly governmental or legal contexts. The articles depict him at memorials, sporting events, rallies and state dinners, surviving and later reflecting on an assassination attempt, joking with allies, welcoming a new grandchild and musing about faith, the afterlife and even becoming pope. Coverage also tracks his media and pop-culture presence — podcast appearances, social media posts involving celebrities, documentaries, and disputes over portraits, NFL team names and booing crowds — alongside stories about his health, his family’s cryptocurrencies, the trading fortunes of Trump-linked companies and Mar-a-Lago as a social and influence hub. Interwoven are pieces on controversial associations and rhetoric (from an Epstein email to 9/11 “inside job” company and attacks on DEI), showing how Trump’s lifestyle, branding and daily behavior continue to generate attention, raise ethical questions and shape how supporters and critics perceive him.

4. The fourth category tracks Trump using the machinery of government—at home and abroad—rather than his rhetoric, image or legal troubles. Domestically, it covers aggressive executive action and restructuring: mass firings and layoffs across the civil service and USAID, efforts to shrink or even dismantle agencies like Education, sweeping Day-1 executive orders, controversial pardons, revoking security protection for political rivals, rebranding FEMA, reshaping Social Security payment systems, and hard-line moves on crime and policing, from putting D.C.’s police under federal control to threatening National Guard deployments in cities such as Chicago and Portland. On policy, it follows sharp shifts on immigration, health and welfare, and a sweeping economic agenda built around tariffs, industrial policy and federal leverage over firms like Intel, U.S. Steel and automakers. Internationally, the stories chart an interventionist, often volatile foreign policy: airstrikes and nuclear brinkmanship with Iran, military pressure on Venezuela, sanctions threats and cease-fire gambits in Ukraine, fraught dealings with NATO and Russian drones over Poland, arms and aid decisions on Taiwan and Israel-Hamas, and summits or calls with Putin, Zelensky, Gulf leaders, Modi and others, alongside allies’ attempts to “manage” or constrain him. Running through the coverage are recurring questions about democratic norms and institutional balance—Trump’s use of “lawfare” against opponents, attempts to bypass Congress on spending and rescissions, clashes with courts and international bodies like the ICC, and the way U.S. allies, markets, and world leaders scramble to react to a presidency that governs through rapid, high-stakes policy shocks.

5. The fifth category covers how Trump’s presidency and political style are received, debated and acted upon across media, institutions and everyday life. The articles include polling on public attitudes toward his performance, commentary on rhetoric, policing and perceived partisanship, and analysis of conspiracy theories and political violence, including reactions to the Jan. 6 pardons and assassination attempts. They track protests, counter-protests and civic mobilization in the U.S. and abroad, as well as responses by religious leaders, advocacy groups and celebrities in sports and entertainment. International pieces highlight how foreign governments and Canadian society react to Trump’s trade threats, tariffs and foreign policy, weighing economic and diplomatic implications. Media-focused stories examine how different outlets and commentators, across the ideological spectrum, frame Trump—sometimes as a danger, sometimes as a corrective or “breath of fresh air”—and how news organizations, tech platforms and cultural institutions navigate their own roles in a highly polarized environment.

6. The sixth category centers on Trump’s family members, close allies, and Trump-branded ventures as they navigate politics, business, media and security in his orbit. Articles follow figures such as JD Vance, Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Hope Hicks and other confidants in roles ranging from high-dollar fundraising, policy and cabinet discussions to public commentary on the 2020 election, immigration and clean energy. They also cover Trump-adjacent business projects and branding efforts, including new products, investments and media deals, alongside diplomatic and institutional disputes involving ambassadors, administration officials and courts. A recurring theme is the personal and security fallout of Trump-era politics — from threats, investigations and memorials after political violence to the intense scrutiny, public profile and loyalty expectations surrounding those closest to him.
