# Trump News Article Typology

## 1. Motivation and Context

This typology is designed to systematically categorize news articles related to Donald Trump.

The goals are:

- to clarify what the primary focus of each article is;
- to enable quantitative and qualitative downstream analysis of media coverage across outlets, ideologies, and countries;
- to support consistent coding by different coders with minimal ambiguity, especially in the context of single coding due to time constraints.

The typology uses six mutually exclusive categories. Each article receives exactly one type. Category 6 is reserved for cases where the main focus is not Trump himself but a Trump-adjacent person or entity, even when the story could otherwise fit Types 1–5. In other words, Type 6 overrides the other types whenever the central subject is someone or something from Trump’s immediate orbit rather than Trump personally.

## 2. Overview of Types and Decision Logic

The six types are:

1. Type 1: Legal and criminal proceedings involving Trump.
2. Type 2: Elections and political dynamics centered on Trump.
3. Type 3: Personal, lifestyle, and business coverage of Trump.
4. Type 4: Governance, policy, and official actions by Trump.
5. Type 5: Societal and media responses to Trump.
6. Type 6: Trump-adjacent focus (family members, close associates, or Trump-branded entities as the main subject).

Each article is coded in two steps:

1. First, the coder decides whether the article’s main subject is Trump himself or a Trump-adjacent actor.
   - If the main subject is a Trump-adjacent person or entity, the coder assigns Type 6, regardless of whether the story concerns legal issues, policy, elections, or reactions.
   - If the main subject is Trump himself, the coder moves to step two.

2. Second, if Trump is the main subject, the coder chooses one of Types 1–5 based on the article’s primary substantive focus, using the order and definitions below.

This structure preserves the topic distinctions among legal, electoral, policy, personal, and societal coverage while ensuring that Trump-adjacent stories are consistently separated into their own category.

## 3. Decision Procedure

For each article, coders should follow this sequence.

1. Identify the main subject of the article.
   - If the headline, lead, and most of the content are primarily about a Trump family member, a close associate, or a Trump-branded organization rather than Trump himself, assign Type 6.
   - If the main subject is Trump himself, continue to the next step.

2. If the main subject is Trump, ask the following questions in order and assign the first type that clearly fits.

   1. Is the article mainly about legal or judicial processes involving Trump, such as charges, trials, rulings, or verdicts?  
      If yes, assign Type 1.

   2. If not, is the article mainly about elections or political dynamics around Trump, such as campaigns, polls, endorsements, or party strategy and reactions?  
      If yes, assign Type 2.

   3. If not, is the article mainly about Trump’s governance, policy decisions, official actions, or formal policy proposals?  
      If yes, assign Type 4.

   4. If not, is the article mainly about Trump’s personal behavior, lifestyle, or business ventures, outside a legal or official policy frame?  
      If yes, assign Type 3.

   5. If none of the above apply, is the article mainly about how society, non-political institutions, or media organizations respond to Trump or Trump-related events?  
      If yes, assign Type 5.

If the article does not fit any of these descriptions after careful reading, coders should flag it for discussion and refinement of the codebook. In practice, almost all Trump-related coverage will fall into one of these six categories.

## 4. Type Definitions

### Type 1: Legal and Criminal Proceedings

Definition: 
Type 1 covers articles that are primarily about legal or judicial processes involving Trump himself. The main storyline is the legal action, such as an investigation, indictment, trial, ruling, or sentencing. Political or public reactions may appear in the article but are treated as secondary context.

Typical inclusions:  
Articles coded as Type 1 usually answer questions like what is happening in the case, what the legal decision was, how the court ruled, or how the process is unfolding procedurally. For example:

- An article that explains a guilty verdict in detail and summarizes the charges and evidence.
- A story about a judge setting a new trial date or changing the terms of bail.
- Coverage of an appellate court ruling that narrows or expands the scope of a case involving Trump.

Typical exclusions:  
Articles should not be coded as Type 1 when legal events are present but not the primary focus. For instance:

- A story whose main theme is how Republican leaders rally around Trump after a verdict belongs in Type 2, because political dynamics are central.
- A piece that focuses on how different news channels covered the trial belongs in Type 5, since it is about media responses.
- A profile of Trump’s personal life that only briefly mentions ongoing litigation belongs in Type 3, not Type 1.

Edge cases:  
Some articles mix legal recap and political implications in roughly equal measure. In such cases, coders should pay close attention to the headline and lead. If those emphasize the case itself and the mechanics of the legal process, the article should be coded as Type 1. If they emphasize what the legal outcome means for the election or for party politics, the article should be coded as Type 2 instead.

If the legal case primarily involves a Trump-adjacent person or organization, and Trump is not the main subject, the article should be coded as Type 6 rather than Type 1, even though the content is legal in nature.

### Type 2: Elections and Political Dynamics

Definition: 
Type 2 covers articles that are primarily about electoral politics and party dynamics centered on Trump. These pieces focus on campaigns, polling, endorsements, intraparty conflicts, or strategic reactions by political actors to Trump or to events involving him.

Typical inclusions:  
Articles coded as Type 2 usually ask questions such as who is supporting or opposing Trump, how events affect his electoral prospects, or what party leaders and other politicians are doing in response. Examples include:

- A story about Republican leaders uniting behind Trump after a legal setback, where the core narrative is party unity or division.
- An article that examines what matters more to swing voters, such as affordability versus Trump, in the context of an upcoming election.
- Coverage of new polls showing Trump leading or trailing in key swing states.
- Reporting on foreign political leaders’ strategic positioning regarding a possible second Trump term.

Typical exclusions:  
Type 2 should not be used when the central theme is a different domain:

- If the main narrative is the substance of a policy decision, such as a new tariff plan, the article belongs in Type 4.
- If the focus is general public attitudes toward Trump outside a clear electoral context, the article belongs in Type 5.
- If the focus is on the details of a court case, the article belongs in Type 1.

Edge cases:  
Articles that weave together legal risk and election strategy can be tricky. When the framing is explicitly about what a legal development means for the campaign or for party control, the article should be coded as Type 2. If the legal events themselves are foregrounded and electoral implications are brief or secondary, the article should be coded as Type 1.

When voter interviews are framed primarily around voting choices, campaign events, or election outcomes, the article should be coded as Type 2. When they are framed as a broader exploration of social attitudes or group identity, without a strong election frame, the article is a better fit for Type 5.

If an election or party story is mainly about a Trump-adjacent figure, such as a family member campaigning on his behalf, and Trump is not the main subject of the article, then the correct code is Type 6.

### Type 3: Personal, Lifestyle, and Business

Definition: 
Type 3 covers articles that focus on Trump’s personal behavior, lifestyle, interpersonal conflicts, or private business ventures, when these are not framed primarily as legal or official political actions. These pieces treat Trump as a celebrity or business figure rather than as a legal defendant or officeholder.

Typical inclusions:  
Articles coded as Type 3 usually highlight personality, image, social life, or commercial activities. For example:

- A story about a lavish party at Mar-a-Lago that concentrates on guests, decor, and Trump’s social presence.
- Coverage of a feud between Trump and a celebrity that centers on insults, social media exchanges, and public drama.
- An article about a new Trump-branded real estate project that treats it mainly as a business or lifestyle story, without a focus on regulation or legal disputes.

Typical exclusions:  
Type 3 should not be used when the main angle is legal, electoral, or policy oriented:

- If the business activity is under investigation or before a court and the story centers on the case, it belongs in Type 1.
- If the behavior is framed as part of campaign strategy or as an official act, it belongs in Type 2 or Type 4.
- If the article is mainly about how companies, activists, or the public respond to Trump’s personal behavior, it belongs in Type 5.

Edge cases:  
Some personal or business stories mention legal scrutiny or regulatory issues. If the legal or regulatory aspect is the core storyline, the article should be coded as Type 1 or Type 4. If those aspects are secondary and the article is more about Trump’s lifestyle or business decisions, the article should remain in Type 3.

If the main subject is a family member’s lifestyle or business choices rather than Trump’s, the article should be coded as Type 6 rather than Type 3.

### Type 4: Governance, Policy, and Official Actions

Definition: 
Type 4 covers articles that focus on Trump’s official or quasi-official political actions. These include governing decisions, policy choices, executive orders, regulations, diplomatic moves, and serious campaign policy proposals.

Typical inclusions:  
Articles coded as Type 4 usually explain what Trump is doing in an official capacity, what a policy contains, or how an official decision is expected to work. Examples include:

- Coverage of Trump signing a bill or executive order into law, with the story focusing on its content and expected impact.
- An article explaining an administration’s rollback of specific environmental regulations.
- Reporting on a major policy pledge in a campaign speech, such as a promised tariff plan or immigration policy, treated primarily as a policy proposal.

Typical exclusions:  
An article should not be coded as Type 4 when another domain is clearly primary:

- If the focus is how political actors react to a policy decision or use it in positioning, it belongs in Type 2.
- If the main storyline is a legal challenge to a policy, such as a lawsuit or court ruling, it belongs in Type 1.
- If the main storyline is the way society, corporations, or media respond to a policy change, it belongs in Type 5.

Edge cases:  
Many policy stories contain both substantive explanation and political reaction. Coders should ask whether the article is more about what the policy is and how it works, or more about who is lining up for or against it. If the policy mechanics and effects dominate, the article belongs in Type 4. If political strategy or partisan conflict dominates, the article belongs in Type 2.

If an article about policy or governance focuses mainly on the actions of a Trump-adjacent actor, such as a family member spearheading an initiative, and Trump himself is not the central subject, the article should be coded as Type 6.

### Type 5: Societal and Media Responses

Definition: 
Type 5 covers articles that focus on how non-political actors and media organizations respond to Trump or Trump-related events. This includes public opinion, protests, activism, corporate decisions, positions taken by universities, religious communities, and the way news outlets and other media portray Trump.

Typical inclusions:  
Articles coded as Type 5 usually center on broader social reactions or media coverage patterns rather than on Trump’s own actions. For example:

- A report on public opinion trends that describes how different demographic groups view Trump, outside a strict horse-race context.
- A story about corporations cutting ties with Trump or distancing themselves from his brand.
- Coverage of celebrities, advocacy organizations, or universities issuing statements in response to a Trump decision.
- An article that analyses how different news channels or newspapers framed Trump’s trial or speech.

Typical exclusions:  
Type 5 should not be used when political elites or legal processes are the primary subject:

- If the main actors are party leaders, elected officials, or candidates, the story belongs in Type 2.
- If the main storyline is the legal process itself, such as a ruling or trial development, it belongs in Type 1.
- If the article focuses on the substance of a policy decision rather than reactions to it, it belongs in Type 4.

Edge cases:  
Articles that combine political actor reactions and broader societal responses can be ambiguous. Coders should identify which set of actors the article foregrounds. If political elites are the primary focus, the article belongs in Type 2. If the emphasis is on non-political organizations, the general public, celebrities, or media framing, the article belongs in Type 5.

If the article focuses on social or media responses to a Trump-adjacent person rather than Trump himself, it should be coded as Type 6.

### Type 6: Trump-Adjacent Focus

Definition: 
Type 6 is reserved for articles whose main subject is not Trump himself but a Trump-adjacent person or entity. This includes close family members, such as his children or spouse, as well as organizations closely associated with Trump, such as the Trump Organization or a Trump-branded media venture. Under this updated rule, Type 6 is applied whenever the main focus is a Trump-adjacent actor, even when the substantive content is legal, electoral, policy-related, personal, or societal.

In other words, Type 6 overrides Types 1–5 whenever the central subject of the article is a Trump-adjacent person or organization and not Trump directly.

Typical inclusions:  
Examples of articles that should be coded as Type 6 include:

- A profile of Ivanka Trump’s decision to step back from politics and focus on her own business ventures, when Trump is only mentioned in passing.
- Coverage of Donald Trump Jr. building his own media brand or leading events for conservative audiences, when the story is really about him and not about Trump’s overall campaign.
- An article about Melania Trump’s absence from public events that examines her role and choices rather than Trump’s actions.
- A report on the Trump Organization’s business strategy, leadership, or internal changes when the focus is the organization itself.

Under this definition, the following are also Type 6:

- A legal story that centers on Eric Trump’s testimony in a civil fraud trial, if the narrative is primarily about his role and experience.
- An article about public controversy surrounding a Trump family member’s statements, if the controversy is about that person directly and Trump only appears in the background.

Typical exclusions:  
Type 6 should not be used when Trump is clearly the main subject and family members or organizations are secondary. For example:

- A story whose headline and narrative focus on Donald Trump’s own indictment or trial should be coded as Type 1, even if it mentions testimony from his children.
- An article that is clearly about Trump’s campaign, in which a family member plays a supporting role, should be coded according to the appropriate Trump-focused type, typically Type 2.

Edge cases:  
Some articles genuinely balance attention between Trump and a family member or organization. In such situations, coders should look carefully at the headline, lead, and framing. If the framing invites the reader to see the story as primarily about the family member or organization, the article should be coded as Type 6. If the framing presents Trump as the central actor and the family member as a supporting character, the article should be coded with the appropriate Trump-focused type.

Because Type 6 is more or less an override category based on the main subject, coders should think of it as the first decision point. If the subject is primarily Trump-adjacent, the article is Type 6. Only when Trump himself is the primary subject should Types 1–5 be considered.

## 5. Comprehensiveness and Mutual Exclusivity

This typology is intended to be both comprehensive and mutually exclusive under realistic coding constraints.

It is comprehensive because every Trump-related news story will almost always be structured around either Trump himself or his immediate orbit, and around one of a small number of recurring themes: legal accountability, electoral politics, governance and policy, personal and business life, or societal and media responses. The six categories map directly onto these themes, with Type 6 capturing cases where the focus shifts from Trump to his close associates or organizations.

It is mutually exclusive because each article is assigned a single type based on a clear, ordered decision process. The first question is whether Trump or a Trump-adjacent actor is the main subject. If it is a Trump-adjacent actor, Type 6 is applied by design. If it is Trump himself, the coder chooses among Types 1–5 by following a fixed order of substantive questions. This reduces the scope for coder discretion in ambiguous mixed-content stories and should improve reliability.

With clear definitions, narrative examples, and explicit tie-breaking rules, this typology provides a practical and robust framework for coding Trump-related news in a way that is transparent, reproducible, and analytically useful.
