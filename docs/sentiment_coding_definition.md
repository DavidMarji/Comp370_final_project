### Positive

    Coverage is coded Positive when the title and opening clearly frame Trump or an outcome for Trump in a favorable or sympathetic way. In this dataset, that often looks like:
        
        1) Wins, gains, or good news for Trump presented as the main point of the story (not articles just reporting on his winning but articles using positive language like "historic return", "record breaking", etc.):
        
            e.g., “Donald Trump wins the Republican presidential primary in ”, “wins 2nd term in historic return,” “endorsement” pieces where the tone is straightforward or framed as a significant success.

        2) Favorable evaluations of Trump’s actions, leadership, or strategy, even if described in political or legal contexts.

        3) Praise, approval, or language that treats his decisions as smart, effective, or justified.

        4) Sympathetic or humanizing framing, including stories that emphasize him as a victim (e.g., assassination attempt coverage) in a way that invites empathy rather than blame.

        5) Positive spin on legal or institutional outcomes that help him (e.g., dismissal of charges, immunity ruling) when the framing is “good news for Trump,” “boost,” “victory,” or similar.


### Negative

    Coverage is coded Negative when the title and/or opening primarily frame Trump in a critical, damaging, or unfavorable way. In the dataset this often includes:

        1) Legal and scandal language that centers his alleged wrongdoing or guilt:

            “criminal conviction,” “weakness,” “failures,” “lawfare,” “strip them of legal status,” “under scrutiny,” “attack underscores Trump’s failures,” etc.

        2) Stories emphasizing harm, risk, or backlash linked to Trump’s actions, such as tariffs “hurting” companies, undermining trade, or causing economic “mess,” especially when framed as his fault.

        3) Opinion or analysis pieces that clearly take a stance against him, using negative adjectives, strong criticism, or a narrative of incompetence, corruption, danger, or chaos.

        4) Comparative frames where Trump is the ‘worse’ side, e.g., head-to-head contrasts where his side is described with more negative language than the other actor.

### Neutral

    Coverage is coded Neutral when the title and opening present Trump without clear evaluative judgment. If it is not clearly positive or clearly negative, it is treated as neutral. In this dataset, this often includes:

        1) Straight news / event coverage, e.g.:

            “Trump says he will meet with Narendra Modi during Indian prime minister’s visit to US”

            “Trump rallies in Pennsylvania,” “Trump attends memorial,” etc., when described factually.

        2) Election results and polls that just state outcomes/numbers without clearly positive/negative language use (“wins primary in X” can be Neutral if written as pure result reporting rather than “historic” or highly celebratory).

        3) Stories where Trump is mentioned but not the main evaluative target, like:

            “Macron visits Greenland in show of support for territory coveted by Trump”
            Here, the framing is about Macron and Greenland; Trump is background, and there’s no strong sentiment about him.

        4) Mixed pieces where both praise and criticism are briefly mentioned, but the early framing doesn’t lean clearly in either direction.
