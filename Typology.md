# Trump News Article Typology

## Motivation & Context
This typology exists to systematically categorize news articles related to Donald Trump. Consistent categorization allows researchers to:  

- **Maintain clarity** on article focus.  
- **Enable quantitative analyses** of coverage.  

By defining clear categories, we reduce ambiguity and ensure that analyses of media coverage are both replicable and meaningful.


## Overview of Types
This typology divides Trump-related news into six mutually exclusive types. 

| Type | Primary Focus | Distinction |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Criminal proceedings | Judicial processes, trials, verdicts |
| 2 | Political entity relations | Responses or interactions from political actors |
| 3 | Trump’s personal actions | Private behavior, celebrity persona, business activity |
| 4 | Political actions under Trump | Official governmental actions, executive orders, campaigns |
| 5 | Public relations | Responses from the general public, NGOs, celebrities, civil society |
| 6 | Trump-adjacent entities | Family members, relatives, Trump-related organizations |


## Typology Details

### **TYPE 1 — Criminal Proceedings**
**Definition:**  
Articles primarily covering legal processes involving Trump, including charges, trials, hearings, verdicts, motions, evidence, and judicial outcomes. Public or political reactions may appear, but the legal process is central.

- *“Trump’s guilty verdict shocks political world.”* → Focused on verdict itself.  
- *“Jury deliberations enter day three in hush-money case.”* → Procedural focus.  
- *“Judge sets new trial date in classified documents case.”* → Core legal development.

**Negative Examples (Exclusion):**  
- *“GOP rallies around Trump after trial.”* → Political relations, Type 2.  
- *“How CNN and Fox portrayed the trial differently.”* → Public relations, Type 5.

**Edge Cases:**  
- Articles mixing legal recap + political implications → include only if ≥60% is legal.   

**Rule:** Include when legal processes are the primary subject; exclude when focus is political, public, or public relations.
